# OpenAI API CLI

## Introduction

AI tools like GPT-4 have transformed how we approach software development. Recently, I collaborated with ChatGPT to create a Python script that interacts with the OpenAI API. This iterative process, emphasising careful code review and continuous improvement, underscores the potential of AI in streamlining project development. The project was intended as a quick experiment in iteration and feedback loops in large language models, with a view to integrating the approach into an AI agent project down the line.

## Project Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to experiment with GPT-4o and iterative loops to enhance the output of AI agent-based systems. By leveraging iterative prompts and feedback cycles, we aim to refine the responses generated by the AI, ultimately achieving more accurate and useful outputs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.2
- `venv` for virtual environment management

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd your_project
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up your OpenAI API key:**

    Ensure you have your OpenAI API key stored in an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To run the script with default settings:

```bash
python main.py "Your user input here"
```

### Specifying a System Prompt

You can specify a different system prompt file:

```bash
python main.py "Your user input here" --system_prompt ./path/to/your_system_prompt.txt
```

### Using a Configuration YAML File

You can use a configuration YAML file to specify the API key, base URL, and system prompt:

```bash
python main.py "Your user input here" --config ./config/example_config.yaml
```

Example `config/example_config.yaml`:

```yaml
api_key: "your_api_key_here"
api_base: "http://localhost:8000/v1"
system_prompt: "This is a custom system prompt."
```

### Multiple Runs

To run the model multiple times:

```bash
python main.py "Your user input here" --runs 5
```

The output will be saved in the `./output` directory with filenames indicating the date and run number.

## Project Structure and Configuration

The project consists of several files:

- `main.py`: The primary script.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists necessary libraries.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: Provides setup and usage instructions.
- Default system prompt and configuration YAML files.

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

Throughout the process, several best practices emerged:

- **Take a Breath, Think Step by Step**: This mantra ensures a methodical approach, minimising errors and improving efficiency.
- **Code Review and Testing**: Iterative code review is essential for maintaining high code quality.
- **Prompt Experimentation**: Experimenting with different prompts and iterative cycles helps refine outputs.

## Additional Information

- The script will default to the public OpenAI API if no config file is specified.
- The script saves each run's output in a JSON file for easy inspection.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that:

- Your Python version is 3.12.2.
- Your virtual environment is activated.
- All required libraries are installed.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using GPT-4 to create functional, complete projects quickly. The iterative approach, combined with prompt experimentation and careful code review, ensures high-quality and efficient outputs. As AI continues to evolve, such methodologies will become increasingly valuable in various domains, enabling rapid development and innovation.
