# Creating a Simple, Complete Project with GPT-4

## Introduction

AI tools like GPT-4 have transformed how we approach software development. Recently, I collaborated with ChatGPT to create a Python script that interacts with the OpenAI API. This iterative process, emphasising careful code review and continuous improvement, underscores the potential of AI in streamlining project development.

## Iterative Approach and Code Review

The project began with a clear objective: to develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with the OpenAI API. Here's a step-by-step overview of the process:

1. **Initial Planning**: Defined project goals and outlined key functionalities.
2. **Initial Implementation**: Created a basic script to take user input, combine it with a system prompt, and interact with the OpenAI API.
3. **Code Review**: Thoroughly reviewed the code to identify and rectify potential issues. This step is crucial in ensuring the code is bug-free and efficient.
4. **Testing and Iteration**: Tested the script, incorporated feedback, and made iterative improvements.

## Project Structure and Configuration

The project consists of several files:

- `main.py`: The primary script.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists necessary libraries.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: Provides setup and usage instructions.
- Default system prompt and configuration YAML files.

## Implementing and Using the Script

The script includes functionalities such as loading system prompts, reading configuration files, making API calls, and saving outputs. Here's an example command to run the script:

```bash
python main.py "Your user input here" --runs 5
```

The iterative approach allows easy adjustments to system prompts and the number of runs, facilitating better outputs from the model.

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

Throughout the process, several best practices emerged:

- **Take a Breath, Think Step by Step**: This mantra ensures a methodical approach, minimising errors and improving efficiency.
- **Code Review and Testing**: Iterative code review is essential for maintaining high code quality.
- **Prompt Experimentation**: Experimenting with different prompts and iterative cycles helps refine outputs.

## Project Availability and Future Applications

The complete project is available on GitHub, providing a practical example of how GPT-4 can be utilised to create simple yet effective tools. This project aims to make it easy to experiment with iterative agent approaches, quickly changing system prompts and the number of cycles to achieve better results.

By leveraging the power of GPT-4, we can significantly streamline the development process, saving time and resources. The iterative approach adopted here highlights the importance of continuous improvement and thorough code review in achieving high-quality outputs.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using GPT-4 to create functional, complete projects quickly. The iterative approach, combined with prompt experimentation and careful code review, ensures high-quality and efficient outputs. As AI continues to evolve, such methodologies will become increasingly valuable in various domains, enabling rapid development and innovation.
