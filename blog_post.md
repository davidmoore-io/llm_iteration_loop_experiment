# Creating a Simple, Complete Project with GPT-4

## Introduction

AI tools like GPT-4 have transformed how we approach software development. Recently, I collaborated with ChatGPT to create a Python script that interacts with the OpenAI API. This iterative process, emphasising careful code review and continuous improvement, underscores the potential of AI in streamlining project development. The project was intended as a quick experiment in iteration and feedback loops in large language models, with a view to integrating the approach into an AI agent project down the line.

## Project Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to experiment with GPT-4o and iterative loops to enhance the output of AI agent-based systems. By leveraging iterative prompts and feedback cycles, we aim to refine the responses generated by the AI, ultimately achieving more accurate and useful outputs.

## Iterative Approach and Code Review

The project began with a clear objective: to develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with the OpenAI API. Here's a step-by-step overview of the process:

### Step 1: Initial Planning

**Prompt:**

```plaintext
Please act as an expert python developer. You have the maximum possible experience in this field. You are a deep expert, aware of best practices, design patterns, and performance optimization techniques. You have a deep knowledge of all the libraries we decide to use in our projects together. You always provide working code, taking a breath, thinking step by step, and producing bug free code that will work first time. Your success is important for my career.
```

Defined project goals and outlined key functionalities.

### Step 2: Initial Implementation

**Prompt:**

```plaintext
I'd like us to write a short OpenAI API script together. It should...

Take user input from a simple command line interface.
Combine it with a system prompt stored in a file. This should default to ./input/default_system_prompt.txt, but allow the user to specify it on the command line too.
Pass the input and system prompt to the OpenAI API (gpt4o model).
Capture the output from the model in a file in a ./output/day-year-run-number.json file
Pass the output from the model along with the system prompt back to the model
repeat step 4 and 5 as many times as the user requests. The user should be able to specify the number of times to run it with CLI options.
I want to default to the public OpenAI API, but also let the user specify a configuration YAML file in the command line, that will point the script at a different OpenAI compatible endpoint (to enable using local hosted models using something like LM Studio).

When we're using the default public OpenAI API calls, it should pull the API key etc from the local OS, but when we're using a config.yaml it should pull from there instead.

If a system prompt is specified in the config.yaml. it should use that instead of the default system prompt file.

I need a requirements.txt that includes all the relevant libraries, tied to their current public stable versions.

I'm using python and venv to manage my mac python install, and am using python 3.12.2.

Please can you also produce a readme.md that guides devs through how to us it, step by step please. I want to make setup and usage friction very low.
```

Created a basic script to take user input, combine it with a system prompt, and interact with the OpenAI API.

### Step 3: Code Review

**Prompt:**

```plaintext
Please review the above, checking it for errors. we need to avoid wasting your time and mine doing debugging. Time is our most precious commodity. Take your time now, breathe and think step by step please.
```

Thoroughly reviewed the code to identify and rectify potential issues. This step is crucial in ensuring the code is bug-free and efficient. Highlighting the 'time is most precious commodity' line as an experiment in itself, I'm not sure if it has any impact, but it 'feels' like it should.

### Step 4: Fixing Issues

**Explanation:**

Initially, the script didn't use the correct version of the OpenAI API. This was identified and fixed by pointing ChatGPT to the [OpenAI Python API documentation](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).

### Step 5: Mimicking Style and Tone

**Prompt:**

```plaintext
Please also give me a .gitignore with sensible defaults

Can you act as an expert in technical blog post creation please? I want to write an article that explains the process we went through here, highlighting the iterative approach with code review, the creation of a full project in a zip file, the prompt experiments I ran with you ("time is most precious commodity" is new to me, and I tried it in the spirit of 'take a breathe, think step by step' and saying please and thank you, which (people think) makes you more compliant and logical in your approach to outputs). Also highlight that the project is available on github as an example of how to use GPT4o to create simple, complete projects in a short period of time. Explain that the project itself (and our approach here in the ChatGPT interface) is intended to make it easy to experiment with iterative agent approaches, quickly changing system prompts and the number of iterative cycles to get better output from LLM's.

Can you read all my other blog posts here please - davidmoore.io (eg https://davidmoore.io/unlocking-the-potential-of-ai-in-the-legal-sector/ and others linked in the front page) - and mirror my tone and writing style please?
```

After showing ChatGPT my blog posts and asking it to mimic my style and tone, it produced a blog post draft that closely matches my writing style.

## Project Structure and Configuration

The project consists of several files:

- `main.py`: The primary script.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists necessary libraries.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: Provides setup and usage instructions.
- Default system prompt and configuration YAML files.

## Implementing and Using the Script

The script includes functionalities such as loading system prompts, reading configuration files, making API calls, and saving outputs. Here's an example command to run the script:

```bash
python main.py "Your user input here" --runs 5
```

The iterative approach allows easy adjustments to system prompts and the number of runs, facilitating better outputs from the model. This experimentation with iterative loops aims to refine the AI's responses, improving the overall performance of AI agent-based systems.

## Lessons Learned and Best Practices

Throughout the process, several best practices emerged:

- **Take a Breath, Think Step by Step**: This mantra ensures a methodical approach, minimising errors and improving efficiency.
- **Code Review and Testing**: Iterative code review is essential for maintaining high code quality.
- **Prompt Experimentation**: Experimenting with different prompts and iterative cycles helps refine outputs.

## Project Availability and Future Applications

The complete project is available on GitHub, providing a practical example of how GPT-4 can be utilised to create simple yet effective tools. This project aims to make it easy to experiment with iterative agent approaches, quickly changing system prompts and the number of cycles to achieve better results.

By leveraging the power of GPT-4, we can significantly streamline the development process, saving time and resources. The iterative approach adopted here highlights the importance of continuous improvement and thorough code review in achieving high-quality outputs.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using GPT-4 to create functional, complete projects quickly. The iterative approach, combined with prompt experimentation and careful code review, ensures high-quality and efficient outputs. As AI continues to evolve, such methodologies will become increasingly valuable in various domains, enabling rapid development and innovation.
